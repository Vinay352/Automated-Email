# Automated-Email
The idea of this python program is basically send emails from your python script without having to open the browser, then click gmail, enter your account credentials, then you create a mail which you later send it to some recipient. All this work is done in this script in one go and hence it saves a person from having to go theough such a long procedure of mailing something to someone.

The program uses gmail for mailing purposes. The program is capable of sending text messages and image file as attachments only. The user is asked to enter the message i.e., the body of the mail, user address mail, user password, recipient password and subject of the mail. At the end, upon successful mailing, the program outputs a message saying "successfully sent email to (the recipient)".
